Sujay2020,Sujay,The Trinion with a Twist,,2020,"In 2015, Beem, Lemos, Liendo, Peelaers, Rastelli and van Rees found a remarkable correspondence between SCFTs in 4d with N ≥ 2 and Vertex Algebras. The vertex algebras associated to theories of Class S are of particular interest — as they exhibit rich algebraic structures arising from the requirement of generalised S-duality. Indeed, it was shown by Beem, Peelaers, Rastelli and van Rees that one may construct all such vertex algebras starting from the vertex algebra of the three punctured sphere, i.e. the trinion vertex algebra. In 2018, Arakawa found an explicit construction of these vertex algebras for the genus zero case. I shall discuss the extension of Arakawa’s construction to the twisted puncture setting."
Diego2020,Diego,Spectral Sequences and Chiral Rings,,2020,"I will introduce the fascinating topic of chiral rings and their relation to topological data latent in the definition of an N = 2 four dimensional superconformal field theory. Of prime importance is our ability to compute chiral rings using spectral sequences. This computational tool makes evident the mathematical nature of certain chiral rings, in particular the Hall-Littlewood Chiral Ring, an object we will discuss at length."
Giulia2020,Giulia,Worldsheet Formulae for Scattering Amplitudes in 6 and 4d,,2020,"Worldsheet approaches to massless scattering give compact formulae for tree level S-matrices and loop integrands. At tree level, these are in the form of integrals over the moduli space of the marked Riemann sphere, localised on a set of constraints called the scattering equations. I will briefly review the d-dimensional framework (CHY) and focus on dimension-specific formulations in four and six dimensions that rely on spinor helicity and allow for the introduction of fermions and supersymmetry. I will discuss how these formulae can be used to derive scattering amplitudes involving massive particles."
Joseph2020,Joseph,Entropy of Arithmetic Black Holes (pt. I),,2020,"The elliptic genus for the worldvolume theory of a D4-brane wrapping a Calabi-Yau can be decomposed into a product of a generalised Theta function and a certain vector valued modular form. The microstate indices for the D4-D2-D0 states are encapsulated solely by the latter form’s coefficients. These numbers in turn relate to the geometry of the Calabi-Yau. Such forms are completely determined by their polar coefficients- which physically correspond to states violating cosmic censorship- through the Rademacher expansion. In this talk we discuss some general aspects of the theory of such forms, including their asymptotics and the details and subtleties of this expansion. We relate these notions to geometrical questions concerning the celebrated manifold AESZ34."
Pyry2020,Pyry,Entropy of Arithmetic Black Holes (pt. II),,2020,"Attractor mechanism for N = 2, d = 4 SUGRA gives an interesting example of a deep interplay of physics, geometry and number theory. First, I will review attractor mechanism using mainly a somewhat novel D3-brane point of view. I will then use the mechanism to derive an interesting series expansion for the entropy of the black hole. This expansion has a remarkable similarity to modular form asymptotics, and indeed it turns out that at least in some cases, the microstates can be counted by coefficients of a modular form. The coefficients in this modular form are related to topological quantities of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their divisor moduli spaces. Intriguingly, knowing this modular form allows us to easily get conjectural answers to some very complicated geometric questions. Time permitting, I will finish with some philosophical and experimentally-minded remarks."
Julius2020,Julius,Trifectas for T<sub>N</sub> in 5d,,2020,"The trinion theories T<sub>N</sub> are a very well-studied class of field theories with eight supercharges. In 5d they are SCFTs realised as M-theory compactifications on <nobr>C<sup>3</sup>/Z<sub>N</sub> x Z<sub>N</sub></nobr>. We apply to them a multitude of recently developed approaches to studying 5d SCFTs and their IR gauge theory descriptions, reviewing them in the process. Thereby we provide a complete picture of the theories both on the Coulomb branch and Higgs branch."
Horia2020,Horia,5d Seiberg-Witten Geometry of Rank One Theories,,2020,"In this talk I will consider theories obtained from M-theory compactification on <nobr>X × S<sup>1</sup></nobr>, with X an isolated Calabi-Yau threefold and finite size S<sup>1</sup>. The Seiberg-Witten geometry of the resulting KK theories can be obtained using mirror symmetry (for toric X). This should, in principle, be enough to determine the prepotential and the BPS spectrum. I will focus on the KK theories obtained from the E<sub>0</sub> and E<sub>1</sub> five-dimensional SCFTs, considering certain ’geometric engineering limits’ as well."
Marieke2020,Marieke,(Symplectic) Leaves and (5d Higgs) Branches in the Tropical Rain Forest,,2020,"In this talk I will show how to derive the structure of the Higgs branch of a 5d SCFT or gauge theory, given by a generalized toric diagram (GTD), in terms of an edge coloring. This is motivated by a tropical curve decomposition of the dual <nobr>(p, q)</nobr> 5-brane web. The coloring provides a decomposition of the generalized toric polygon into the Minkowski sum of sub-polygons, from which we compute the magnetic quiver. Furthermore, we can determine from identifications of partial resolutions, the symplectic leaves, and thereby the entire structure of the 5d Higgs branch."
Andrea2020,Andrea,Supersymmetric Observables of N=1 Quantum Field Theories on a Twisted S<sup>1</sup> x S<sup>3</sup>,,2020,"Recent years have seen a big progress in the understanding of quantum field theories defined in curved backgrounds. In particular, in the presence of supersymmetry it has been possible to derive many exact results for large classes of background manifolds. In the talk I will consider a simple N=1 quantum field theory defined on a manifold diffeomorphic to S<sup>1</sup> x S<sup>3</sup>, review some known results derived through the technique of dimensional reduction, and explain how they extend to the more general case where the 3-sphere is twisted over the circle. This particular background is relevant in the contest of holography as it corresponds to the boundary of supersymmetric black holes in five-dimensional Anti de Sitter space, with the twisting of the sphere corresponding to rotation parameters. The field theory computations are eventually aimed to tackle the problem of black hole microstate counting."
Carmen2020,Carmen,"Negativities, 3d Higher Spin Gravity and Modular Bootstrap",,2020,"The partition function of 3 dimensional gravity has been an object of interest for quite some time now. However, the numerous attempts on solving it have yielded confusing results: its holographic dual appears to have negative-norm states, which we will revisit and then sketch some of the solutions that have been proposed within the last decade (including very exciting recent findings!). Furthermore, in 3 dimensions we can add higher spin currents to the theory of gravity in an interesting way, and check with its holographic duals (W<sub>N</sub> CFTs) what happens, using bootstrap techniques: not only do these results have an interest on their own from both sides of the duality, but they can also help us understand better the simpler case of ”normal” gravity and Virasoro CFTs."
Mateo2020,Mateo,An Explicit Example of a Family of Heterotic G<sub>2</sub> Systems,,2020,"In this talk I will begin reviewing heterotic G2 systems, that is: compactifications of the heterotic string on a manifold with G2 structure preserving N = 1 SUSY in 3 dimensions. I will then discuss the construction of an explicit family of examples of these systems."
Dewi2020,Dewi,Horizon Molecules in Causal Set Theory,,2020,"We propose a new definition of “horizon molecules” in Causal Set Theory following pioneering work by Dou and Sorkin. The new concept applies for any causal horizon and its intersection with any spacelike hypersurface. In the continuum limit, as the discreteness scale tends to zero, the leading behaviour of the expected number of horizon molecules is shown to be the area of the horizon in discreteness units, up to a dimension dependent factor of order one. We also determine the first order corrections to the continuum value, and show how such corrections can be exploited to obtain further geometrical information about the horizon and the spacelike hypersurface from the causal set."
Palash2020,Palash,Modular Bootstrap and Classification of Rational CFT,,2020,"I will describe the recent progress on the application of modular bootstrap, in the form of modular linear differential equations, to the classification problem of three-character CFT (based on arXiv:2002.01949). The primary focus will be on discovering and utilising the ”quasi-character” solutions, as well as the novel coset construction of arXiv:1602.01022."
Atul2020,Atul,Celestialology,,2020,"Celestial conformal field theory is a budding field delving into a new proposal for flat holography: Mellin transformed 4d scattering amplitudes might secretly be the correlators of some 2d CFT living on the sky. After giving a brief introduction to the idea, I will describe ongoing work in reconstructing bulk physics from the conjectured operator algebra of this boundary CFT. In particular, we will see how some standard footprints of locality in gluon amplitudes can emerge purely as byproducts of the OPE combined with conjectured symmetries of this CFT."
Atul2021,Atul,The symmetries of nature,,2021,"Weinberg's soft theorems for gluon and graviton scattering in our 4d universe look eerily like the Ward identities of a 2d CFT living on the sky. The latter is dubbed a ""celestial CFT"" and is conjectured to be the holographic dual of flat space physics. I will review these facts and discuss how further soft theorems give rise to infinitely many extra global symmetries of this 2d CFT on top of the usual Virasoro algebra. Like a true Christie, the search for their origins brings us to a culprit that would hardly be suspected at first: twistor theory!"
Giulia2021,Giulia,Massive amplitudes from the worldsheet,,2021,"I will introduce new ambitwistor-string models for theories with massive particles. These lead to formulae for amplitudes that rely on a massive version of the scattering equations. A twistorial model in four dimensions produces amplitudes for the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM and gives an off-shell extension of previously known massless models, thus allowing the treatment of loop insertions in twistorial amplitude formulae for supersymmetric theories in 4d."
Sujay2021,Sujay,Un-Higgsing the Higgs Branch,,2021,"In this talk I will explain how one may fight back against the tyranny of Peter Higgs and his mechanism in the setting of 4D N=2 SCFTs. With knowledge of the IR theory, one may recover certain protected sectors of the UV theory using the Free-Field Realisation of Beem, Meneghelli and Rastelli."
Palash2021,Palash,Superconformal Indices BUT they're not just modular,,2021,"In 2013, Beem and his collaborators found a remarkable correspondence between 4d N=2 superconformal field theories and 2d vertex operator algebras (VOA). One of the manifestations of this correspondence is the relation between the (Schur limit of the) superconformal index and the vacuum character of the corresponding VOA. Through the extensive work on 2d CFTs (inherently related to 2d VOAs), one knows a lot about their character and in particular about their modular properties. The correspondence then implies the existence of modularity in the Schur index. In this talk, I will discuss the modular properties of the Schur index of 4d N=2 SCFTs, focusing on an important class of theories known as Class S theories, as well as the 4d N=4 SYM with gauge group SU(M). As we will see, modular forms do not suffice to describe these indices and one has to expand to the notion of ``quasi-modularity”."
Pyry2021,Pyry,Attractive Calabi-Yau Manifolds,,2021,"Attractor equations in d=4, N=2 supergravity theories are differential equations which fix the continuous moduli of ½-BPS black hole solutions as functions of the black hole charges. Particularly interesting examples of these supergravities are provided by Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II string theories, where the continuous moduli are the geometric moduli, and the attractor mechanism can be viewed as fixing the integral geometry of the black hole. We develop a method for solving the attractor equations for CYs with large complex structure. This allows us to write a surprisingly simple formula for the fully instanton-corrected black hole entropy. The geometric invariants appearing in this formula give a strong hint of microstate contributions, which motivates deeper study of some related geometries."
Joseph2021,Joseph,Flux Modularity,,2021,"To any rational elliptic curve one can associate a weight-two modular form: this is the celebrated modularity theorem. There is a wide-reaching program underway to prove that some similar relationship holds between Calabi-Yau manifolds (of which elliptic curves are the 1-dimensional case) and automorphic forms (of which modular forms are a straightforward case). It has been conjectured recently that the physics of flux compactifications, initially studied by string-cosmologists, gives rise to Calabi-Yau manifolds associated to modular forms. Moreover, the associated elliptic curve appears as the F-theory fibre. In this talk I discuss recent work, wherein we study this correspondence in the case of a particular five-parameter model. This model is chosen because (1) we have recently developed the necessary detailed understanding of the geometry and (2) quotients of these manifolds were previously shown to have interesting modularity properties in the context of black holes. These properties give us both a (very surprisingly) good handle of the elliptic fibre and a novel testbed for comparing the different origins of modularity in supersymmetric physics."
Marieke2021,Marieke,Connecting the Higgs Branches of 5d SCFTs,,2021,"I will describe how the geometry of the Higgs branch of 5d SCFTs is transformed under movement along the extended Coulomb branch. By working directly with the magnetic quiver, I will demonstrate a correspondence between Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations in 3d and 5d mass deformations. When the Higgs branch has multiple cones and the mirror map is not globally well-defined, we are able to utilize this correspondence to establish a local version of mirror symmetry."
Horia2021,Horia,The U-plane of rank-one 4d N=2 KK theories,,2021,"In this talk I will review some aspects of the Seiberg-Witten description of the Coulomb branch of rank-one 4d N=2 supersymmetric QFTs, emphasizing certain links with the theory of rational elliptic surfaces. The configurations of Kodaira fibers of such surfaces have been classified by Persson and Miranda and serve as a tool for understanding RG flows and the (global) flavour symmetry. Additionally, many of these surfaces have interesting modular properties which can be used to find the spectrum of light particles at strong coupling and the associated BPS quivers."
Lea2021,Lea,SQFT dualities and their index identities,,2021,"Among the phenomena that can characterize the low energy dynamics of a 4d N=1 SQFT, infra-red dualities play a central role, and their study can provide numerous insights on the strongly-coupled regime of a theory. Here I will present some techniques to derive dualities for USp(2N) quiver gauge theories, essentially based on the idea of obtaining new conjectures by applying in an iterative way other more elementary Seiberg-like dualities, which we assume as fundamental. The central tool we use in our derivation is the supersymmetric index, which, for 4d N=1 SQFTs, can be written as an elliptic hypergeometrical integral. In this way physical dualities translate into mathematical identities between those kinds of integrals, providing a nice interplay between the two areas of research."
Enrico2021,Enrico,More than a circle... A tale about T-duality,,2021,"T-duality, in String Theory, is usually associated with a very mild setup: a circle compactification. However, it is possible to study a generalized T-duality procedure that allows us to say non-trivial things about dualities between more challenging scenarios. Interesting things happen in combination with additional symmetries on the worldsheet and G-structures. To spice things up, we focus on Heterotic String Theory and we add a gauge bundle to the equation."
Mateo2021,Mateo,SCFTs 4 ETCS & GCS: WTF?,,2021,"I will start my talk by solving the mystery of what all these acronyms mean. Then I will explain how the geometric structure of some manifolds can be understood by putting a string theory on them and looking at the worldsheet algebra. Finally, I will use this technique in a particular case to gain insight into the existence of certain manifolds and to (try to) understand Spin(7) mirror symmetry. Spoiler alert: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05716"
Maria2021,Maria,Random perturbations of the O(2) vector model,,2021,"The presence of impurities and defects in real systems requires the extension of the standard apparatus of universality and RG. My research analyses the effect of the introduction of a quenched (i.e. time-independent) disorder in the critical O(2) vector model. How to understand whether the disorder modifies the critical behavior of the pure system, that is a CFT? The so-called Harris criterion allows for the qualitative prediction of the pure fixed point stability against disorder. By using the Replica Trick, one obtains a set of (n) identical independent copies of the initial system, each of them coupled to the same disorder. However, the Path Integral in the impurities leads to an interaction term between the replicas. I study the evolution of the related coupling with the tools of Conformal Perturbation Theory: knowing the pure theory CFT data (the correlators), one can deduce the properties of the random system by studying the RG flow. I focus on the random temperature perturbation, namely the insertion of the O(2) singlet with a random coupling. My strategy is to perform the analysis in d=4-ε and then attempt the computation directly in d=3, when the starting point is a strongly interacting CFT, investigated with numerical conformal bootstrap techniques. Then, I present the new interesting case of a random perturbation associated with the lowest-dimension charge-2 scalar of the O(2) model. One expects to find a new IR fixed point since this operator should be relevant in d=3 from conformal bootstrap studies. Moreover, contrary to the random temperature case, this perturbation is charged under the O(2) group: will it induce a global symmetry breaking?"
Andrea2021,Andrea,"Hey, I just met you and this is singular...",,2021,
Pietro2021,Pietro,"... But here's my (Euler) number, so call me spindle",,2021,"I will give an overview of the spindle solutions that have been considered so far in the context of consistent truncations of D=10,11 supergravities, highlighting the main features of each case. In particular, I will discuss the two possible “twists” that allow for supersymmetry to be preserved when compactifying a theory on a spindle, explaining their relation to the more standard topological twist. Finally, I will focus on the case of 4d minimal gauged supergravity, where a UV completion of the near-horizon spindle solutions is known: the Plebanski-Demianski accelerating black holes."
Dewi2021,Dewi,"Holography, 1-Form Symmetries, and Confinement",,2021,"In this talk I wish to introduce the audience to higher-form symmetries (HFS) and what one can do with them. Specifically, I will cover: HFS in generality, how they appear in holography, what they have to do with confinement, and their mixed anomalies with ordinary symmetries. I will focus on 4d N=1 SU(N) SYM and derive its 1-form symmetry, confinement properties and a mixed anomaly that is related to chiral symmetry breaking."
Giuseppe2021,Giuseppe,Non-supersymmetric brane profiles and dilaton tadpoles,,2021,"In ""ordinary"" string theory, D-branes can be either described from a microscopic point of view, or as extended solutions of the corresponding low-energy supergravity. In this talk, I try to address some aspects of analogous low-energy solutions in non-supersymmetric string theories. I start recalling the construction of non-supersymmetric, non-tachyonic string theories and focusing on the resulting low-energy theory. Then, I specialize the equations of motion to a brane geometry and discuss their properties. In the absence of supersymmetry, the most striking feature of these solutions is arguably the presence of a spontaneously compactified radial direction, which replaces the usual asymptotically flat structure far away from the brane."
